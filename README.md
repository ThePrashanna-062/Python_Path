# Python Learning Path

This repository is a record of my journey learning **Python programming**.

I created this repo to learn Python in a structured way, practice regularly, and understand concepts by writing code—not just reading theory. Everything here is written while learning, so the progress is real and gradual.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- To build strong Python fundamentals
- To practice problem-solving using Python
- To keep my learning organized and easy to revise
- To slowly move from basics to real-world use cases

This is not a tutorial repo.  
This is a **learning-in-public** repo.
